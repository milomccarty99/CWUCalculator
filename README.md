# Desktop Calculator
####  Milo McCarty - CS480
Hello, this is my desktop calculator for CS480. It uses the [shunting yard algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting_yard_algorithm) to parse the input it is given. On Windows operating systems, this applet should work just fine. 

I made this using Windows forms since I wanted to code this project in C#.

## Usage
The buttons are very straight forward. My aim was to implement basic functionality of a calculator. Make sure you are closing any parenthases that you are opening otherwise you are going to get an error message.
